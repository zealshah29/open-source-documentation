Here's a step-by-step guide on how to contribute to someone's repository on GitHub.

**Step 1: Fork the Repository**
Go to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to.
Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository page.
This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

**Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository**
Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows).
To clone the repository using HTTPS, copy the link under "HTTPS".
To clone the repository using an SSH key, include a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, and copy the link under "SSH".
To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub "CLI", and copy the link under it. 
Open the terminal, write `git clone` and paste your link.

For example: `git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git`

**Step 3: Create a Branch**
Change into the repository's directory:
`cd [repository-name]`
Create a new branch for your changes. Choose a descriptive branch name related to your contribution:
`git checkout -b feature/my-contribution`
