If you are looking for beginner-friendly projects on GitHub, you can follow the given steps:

### Search by topics:

If there's a particular topic that interests you, visit 
`github.com/topics/<topic>`. 
For example, if you are interested in web development, you can find relevant projects and good first issues by visiting 
`https://github.com/topics/web-development`.

You can further narrow down  your selection by using **Language** and **Sort** dropdown menus.

### GitHub Labels:

Many open-source projects use labels like "beginner," "good first issue," or "first-timers-only" to indicate tasks suitable for newcomers.
Navigate to the "Issues" section of a repository you like and filter by these labels to find entry-level tasks.

Tip: When choosing a repository to contribute to on GitHub, look for maintainers who are responsive, supportive, and communicate clearly. Seek out projects with a positive code review process, well-maintained documentation, and a welcoming community. Check the commit history to see if the maintainers regularly update the project. Regular updates indicate an active and well-maintained project.

### External Platforms:

Platforms like "Up For Grabs" or "Good First Issues" aggregate beginner-friendly issues from various repositories. Visit these platforms to discover curated tasks across different projects.

### Community Involvement:

Join developer communities or forums related to your interests (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Discord, or specialized forums).
Seek recommendations from community members about beginner-friendly projects.

Once you find a potential project, thoroughly read its documentation and contributing guidelines. Understand the project's purpose, architecture, and development workflow. Follow any specific setup instructions provided in the documentation. Engage with the project's community through communication channels like Discord, Slack, or mailing lists. Ask questions, express your interest in contributing, and seek guidance on suitable beginner tasks. 

Finally, familiarize yourself with version control systems, especially Git, as GitHub heavily relies on it. Learn how to fork a repository, create branches, make changes, and submit pull requests. You can refer to my blog on [How to contribute to someone's repository on GitHub](https://zealshah29.github.io/open-source-documentation/2024/01/17/How-to-contribute-to-someone's-repository-on-github.html) to learn this. 

Happy Contributing!
